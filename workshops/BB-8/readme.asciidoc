[[How_To_Make_Program]]
== How to make a new program

When you launch Sphero Edu, you wil see four tabs at the bottom. Go to the "`Programs`" tab to create and edit programs.

To make a new program:

. Click on the "+`" button at the bottom-right corner. 
. In the popup window that appears, enter a program name, select "`Blocks`" as the program type, and serlect "`BB-8`" in the "`Choose Compatible Robots`" section.

. Click "`Create`" to create the program.

== Activities

The description of these activities includes a brief description of the activity, the final code, and how to test it. If you need help creating a program, refer to the <<How_To_Make_Program>> section.

[[Activity_1]]
=== 1. Run from the Stormtroopers

==== Description

The stormtroopers are trying to capture BB-8! He has to go fast and use evasive maneuvers to outrun them.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_1>>.

[[program_1]]
.Activity 1 finished code
image::images/program-1.png[]

==== Try it!

. Find a long space with lots of room for BB-8 to go forwards - this activity involves a lot of movement (for BB-8).
. Start the project!
. BB-8 should move forwards, then move diagonally to the right, then move diagonally to the left.

[[Activity_2]]
=== 2. Escaped!

==== Description

BB-8 has escaped the pursuing stormtroopers, and he is very happy, so he is doing a victory dance.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_2>>.

==== Try it!

. This activity does not require a very large space, but you do need some space for BB-8 to move around in. Find a reasonable amount of space.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 should start spinning around really fast.

[[Activity_3]]
=== 3. Base Infiltration

==== Description

BB-8 is waiting outside an enemy base. When he gets the signal, he will infiltrate the base and find a good spot to spy from. He will need to be completely still, and he will also turn off his bright lights.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_3>>.

[[program_3]]
.Activity 3 finished code
image::images/program-3.png[]

==== Try it!

. Find a place with some obstacles to maneuver around.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 will move forward (pretend he is going into a base) and eventually stop. Once he does stop, he will wait until he is completely still before turning his lights off. From this vantage point, he will “spy on” the Imperial stormtroopers.

[[Activity_4]]
=== 4. Exploring

==== Description

BB-8 is doing some exploring to map out the area.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_4>>.

[[program_4]]
.Activity 4 finished code
image::images/program-4.png[]

==== Try it!

. Find an area with lots of walls and objects to collide into.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 will move around the area, and whenever he bumps into something, he will turn away from it and move somewhere else.

[[Activity_5]]
=== 5. Speedometer

==== Description

The Resistance is testing out a new, color-coded speedometer in BB-8.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_5>>.

[[program_5]]
.Activity 5 finished code
image::images/program-5.png[]

==== Try it!

. Find a place similar to that of activity <<Activity_1>> - that is, a long and possibly narrow space.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 will move forward five times, each time with a different speed. Depending on his speed, he will be colored from green to red, with green being lower speed and red being higher speed.

[[Activity_6]]
=== 6. Party!!!

==== Description

The Resistance has a party after blowing up an Imperial Stardestroyer, and BB-8 is showing off his dance moves.

==== Final Code

When you are done, the code for BB-8 should look like <<program_6>>.

[[program_6]]
.Activity 6 finished code
image::images/program-6.png[]

==== Try it!

. Find any reasonably large area for this project.
. Make sure your mobile device's volume is on.
. Start the project!
. BB-8 will start performing random actions from a list of: spinning, doing an animation and changing to a random color, saying "it's party time", or moving randomly.
